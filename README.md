Learning Web Dev, CRUD, and other fundamentals of programming using Javascript and C++. 
The goal is to become proficient in programming so that I can create interesting apps, websites, video games and much more.
So far I've only been following toturials and using ChatGPT to build the following programs / apps:
- To-do App (js)
- Simple Social Media App (js)
- Rock, Paper, Scissors Game (js)
- Calculator Program (c++)
- Fortune Teller Program (c++) 

I will also be uploading random programs to this repo for the documentaion of my programming journey.
Coding snipets from books will be here as well. 
Some projects using OpenGL will be uploaded into this repo too.
Throughout my journery I will also be learning the basics of source control. 
I have the intention of being able to contribute to 
other repositories in the furture. I want to learn to collaborate effectively on software projects. 
Collaboration is important.
