Learning Web Dev, CRUD, and other fundamentals of programming using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
The goal is to become proficient in programming so that I can create interesting apps, websites, video games and much more.
I also want to learn source control so I can contribute to repos and collaborate with other developers. 
I will also be uploading random programs to this repo for the documentaion of my programming journey.
I also want to learn other languages like:
- Rust
- C++

  ChatGPT and Grok are my best friends :)
