**Program 3D animations and visualizations for the web with JavaScript and WebGL**

## What is this book about?

This book is for JavaScript developers looking to learn the use of Three.js library.	

This book covers the following exciting features:

* Implement the different camera controls provided by Three.js to navigate your 3D scene
* Discover working with vertices directly to create snow, rain, and galaxy-like effects
* Import and animate models from external formats, such as glTF, OBJ, STL, and COLLADA
* Design and run animations using morph targets and bone-based animation
* Create realistic-looking 3D objects using advanced textures on materials
* Interact directly with WebGL by creating custom vertex and fragment shaders
* Make scenes using the Rapier physics engine, and integrate Three.js with VR and AR

const normalMap = new THREE.TextureLoader().load('/assets/textures/red-bricks/red_bricks_04_nor_gl_1k.jpg',(texture) => {
    texture.wrapS = THREE.RepeatWrapping
    texture.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping
    texture.repeat.set(4, 4)
  }
)

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

Three.js has become the industry standard for creating stunning 3D WebGL content.
