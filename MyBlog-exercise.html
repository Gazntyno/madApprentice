            <h3>Why Am I Here?</h3>
                <article>
                    <p> 
                        I have a strong desire to create unique and engaging experiences within the digital realm. It's really all I think about for the most part. 
                        Ideas practically ooze out of me. There's something about thinking deeply about things that don't exist yet that heavily stimulates my mind.
                        I plan to make a few of those crazy ideas a reality, I believe that is why I am here on this earth. I want to show people that it's okay to 
                        dream big and think outside the box, to go in your own direction instead of following the norm. As we humans grow older something happens to us along the way 
                        and we forget what it's like to ask those seemingly ridiculous questions and entertain those wild ideas. Our inner child gets suppressed by the conventions of society 
                        and most of us adhere to these conventions. I will not. I refuse. I do not care if people look at me like I am insane. I will continue on my path to creating things that go against the norm. It is why I am here 
                        after all. And I am content with this truth for it gives me purpose. So no matter how life turns out I will always give my work everything I've got for this is 
                        truly all that I have. Why are you here?
