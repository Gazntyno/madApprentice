          <p>
            I decided to learn how to code becasue I wanted to make video games
            and still do actually. Though <b>web development</b> seemed a lot
            more feasible in terms of being able to land a job and start earning
            money from it. So that's why I chose web dev. I like the idea of
            making <em>visual experiences</em> that users can interact with. I
            plan to earn income as a web developer so I can fund the games I
            want to create. So far the journey has been rewarding and fun! I'm
            looking forward to seeing how far I can take my creative abilites.

        <h3>Why Video Games?</h3>
        <hr />
        <article>
          <p>
            Like many other people I find <b>video games</b> to be incredibley
            engaging and stimulating for the mind. Though nowadays games aren't
            developed with the same amount of love as they once were. This
            saddens me, which is one of the main reasons why I want to make
            games. I believe I can make something truly great. I want to show
            gamers what they are missing and why they shouldn't settle for the
            half-baked releases these AAA studios are doing. Players deserve
            <em>quality gaming experiences</em>.

        <h3>Why Create?</h3>

          <p>
            I believe humans are creators by nature. Ideas are a form of
            creation. One could <b>create</b> an entire world in their mind if
            they so choose. The proccess of creating something from ideation to
            physical / digital manifestation is <em>extremely rewarding</em> to
            me. Ideas are abundant, people to plan and execute those ideas are
            not.
