            <h3>Why Web Dev?</h3>
                <article>
                    <p> 
                       I decided to learn how to code becasue I wanted to make video games and still do actually. Though web development seemed a lot more feasible in terms of being able to land a job and start earning money from it. 
                       So that's why I chose web dev. I like the idea of making visual experiences that users can interact with. I plan to earn income as a web developer so I can fund 
                       the games I want to create. So far the journey has been rewarding and fun! I'm looking forward to seeing how far I can take my creative abilites.

            <h3>Why Video Games?</h3>
                <article>
                    <p> 
                      Like many other people I find video games to be incredibley engaging and stimulating for the mind. Though nowadays games aren't developed with the same amount of love 
                      as they once were. This saddens me, which is one of the main reasons why I want to make games. I believe I can make something truly great. I want to show gamers what they are missing 
                      and why they shouldn't settle for the half-baked releases these AAA studios are doing. Players deserve quality gaming experiences.

            <h3>Why Create?</h3>
                <article>
                    <p> 
                      I believe humans are creators by nature. Ideas are a form of creation. One could create an entire world in their mind if they so choose. 
                      The proccess of creating something from ideation to physical / digital manifestation is extremely rewarding to me. Ideas are abundant, people to plan and execute those
                      ideas are not.
