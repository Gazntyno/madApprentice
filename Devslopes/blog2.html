            With the release of OpenAI's GPT-3, the world has been introduced to
            a new era of AI. This new era is one of
            <b>artificial intelligence</b> and some speculate within a few years
            we will ahieve <em>artificial general intelligence</em>. This is a
            very exciting time for humanity. The possibilities are endless.
            Though with this new technology comes new challenges. One of the
            biggest challenges we will face is the <em>economic impact</em> of
            AI. This is a topic I am very interested in and will be exploring in
            this blog post.

        <hr />
        <article>
          <h4 class="head">Job Market</h4>
          <p>
            The economic impact of AI is a topic that has been discussed
            frequently in the past few years. Many people are concerned about
            the impact AI will have on the job market. Some believe AI will
            replace many jobs, while others believe AI will create more jobs.
            The truth is, no one knows for sure what will happen. Though we can
            make educated guesses based on the current trends. For example, we
            know that AI is already being used to automate many jobs. This is
            already having an impact on the job market. We also know that AI is
            being used to create new jobs. This is also having an impact on the
            job market. So what does this mean? It means that AI is already
            impacting the job market tremendously (even in it's infancy), but it
            is not clear what the trend will be in the short term future. (5-10
            years)
          </p>

          <h4 class="head">Productivity</h4>
          <p>
            There is no doubt that AI will have a huge impact on productivity.
            It already has. GitHub Copilot has significantly influenced the
            amount of code generated in software development. As of early 2023,
            GitHub Copilot is responsible for generating a substantial portion
            of code across various programming languages. On average, 46% of
            developers' code files are generated by GitHub Copilot. This figure
            is even higher in specific programming languages like Java, where
            GitHub Copilot contributes to 61% of the code. So what does this
            mean? Well many speculate that AI will eventually replace
            programmers all together. Though I believe that is a bit of a
            stretch. Atleast for the next few decades. I believe AI will be used
            to automate many tasks that programmers don't want to do. This will
            allow programmers to focus on more important tasks and will increase
            productivity tremendously. Though its too soon to tell for sure so
            who knows, AI might be programming AI within the next few years.

          <p>
            In the next few years, the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on
            the economy is expected to be profound, particularly in terms of
            productivity and the job market. In conclusion, while AI presents
            challenges, particularly in terms of job displacement, its potential
            to drive economic growth and create new opportunities is immense.
            The key will be to harness AI's capabilities responsibly and
            inclusively, ensuring that the economic benefits are widespread and
            that the workforce is equipped to thrive in an AI-enhanced economy.
