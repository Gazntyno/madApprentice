          the positions of the pieces on the board, and the strategies your
          opponent may use can improve your memory and recall abilities.

          <strong>Boosts Cognitive Skills:</strong>
          Playing chess involves critical thinking, concentration, pattern
          recognition, and decision-making, all of which contribute to improved
          cognitive function.
        </p>
        <p id="Benefits">
          <strong>Promotes Creativity:</strong> Chess stimulates the imagination
